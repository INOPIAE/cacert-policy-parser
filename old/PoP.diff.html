<span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>0</span> Preliminaries Policy on Policy adopts the IETF model of 'rough consensus' to create CAcert documents within the open CAcert Policy Group mail list forum.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>1.</span><br/>
<span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>1</span> Scope and Purpose <br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>1.1</span> This policy documents and controls the process by which CAcert creates and promulgates policies.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>1.2</span> The policy covers itself. The policy replaces prior ones. For Audit purposes, the policy is part of the Configuration-Control Specification ("CCS", DRC_A.1) and also documents part of the <span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>CCS.</span><br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>1.3</span> <span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>Configuration-Control Specification (CCS [COD2]).</span> The policies so created are generally binding on CAcert Inc., members under CAcert Community Agreement (CCA <span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>=&gt; COD9)</span> <span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>[COD9])</span> and other related parties under other agreements.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>1.4</span> The Policy Officer manages all policies and the policy group. The policy group is formed on the open mailing list known as CAcert Policy Group, and is to be open to all Community Members of CAcert.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>2.</span><br/>
<span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>2</span> Basic Model <br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>2.1</span> The basic concept was drawn from the IETF model.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>2.2</span> Policies are documented. Documents start as Work-In-Progress, move through to DRAFT and finalise in POLICY status.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>2.3</span> Decisions are taken by "Rough Consensus." A vote may be called to clarify.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>2.4</span> Documents should include a minimum of information in a standardised format managed by the Documentation Officer: the Title, short name, Document Status, date the Status was reached, Editor, date / time of the last edit, Abstract.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>2.5</span> Editors may make the following changes, where it is clear that the change does not change the <span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>policy:</span> <span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>policy. Such changes to be notified to the policy group, and to be folded into effect, etc, without further ado:</span> fixes to errors in grammar and spelling, anchors, HTML errors, URLs &amp; formatting, COD numbers and other references, and other minutiae, as agreed under 2.3. <span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>Such changes to be notified to the policy group, and to be folded into effect, etc, without further ado.</span><br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>2.6</span> Documents of lower status (work-in-progress or DRAFT) must not be confusable with documents of higher status (DRAFT or POLICY). Copies should be eliminated where not being worked on.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>3.</span><br/>
<span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>3</span> Work-In-Progress <br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>3.1</span> An Editor is identified. This person is responsible for drafting the document, following the consensus of the policy group.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>3.2</span> The Policy Officer resolves minor disputes and keeps order.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>3.3</span> The mail list of the policy group is used as the primary debating forum. A sub-group may be formed, but decision-taking should be visible on the main group.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>3.4</span> Documents start with the status of "Work-In-Progress" or WIP for short.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>4.</span><br/>
<span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>4</span> DRAFT status <br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>4.1</span> On completion, a document moves to DRAFT status.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>4.2</span> A DRAFT is a policy-in-effect for the Community and is to be distributed and treated as such.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>4.3</span> As far as the Community is concerned, the DRAFT is policy. Challenges and concerns can be addressed to the policy group, and policy group discussions on a DRAFT may be presented in Dispute Resolution.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>4.4</span> Revisions of DRAFTs must be treated as decisions on the policy group.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>4.5</span> The period of the DRAFT status is announced widely, which should be at least a month and no longer than a year.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>4.6</span> During the period of DRAFT, CAcert Inc. retains a veto over policies that effect the running of CAcert Inc.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>5.</span><br/>
<span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>5</span> POLICY status <br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>5.1</span> After DRAFT period has elapsed with no revision beyond minor and editorial changes, there should be a decision to move the document from DRAFT to POLICY status.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>5.2</span> Once POLICY, the Community may only challenge the document in Dispute Resolution.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>5.3</span> Policy group may propose changes to a POLICY document in order to update it. When changes move to DRAFT status, they may be included in the POLICY document, but must be clearly indicated within as DRAFT not POLICY.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>5.4</span> POLICY documents are published on the CAcert website in plain HTML. Change control must be in place.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>6.</span><br/>
<span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>6</span> Open Process <br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>6.1</span> All policy discussions and documents should be open processes. There should be a fair chance for the Community to have their views heard. Rough Consensus is the working metric.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>6.2</span> Contributions to formally controlled documents such as Policies are transferred fully to CAcert Inc. Copyrights and similar intellectual property rights required to incorporate the Contribution are either transferred to CAcert Inc, or, are issued and contributed under free, open, non-restrictive, irrevocable, exclusive, and clear licence to CAcert Inc. In all cases, CAcert Inc licenses the contributions back to the community under an open licence.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>6.3</span> Contributors declare any conflicts of interest.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>6.4</span> Policies should be issued under free, open, non-restrictive, irrevocable, non-exclusive, and clear licence by CAcert, Inc.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>6.5</span> Mailing lists should be archived, and important meetings should be minuted. A record of decisions is to be maintained.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>7. Disputes. </span><br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>7.1</span><br/>
<span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>7 Disputes</span> Any questions not resolved by these rules may be voted on in the policy group, or may be dealt with in Dispute Resolution.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>7.2</span> The Policy Officer may decide a tight vote in a minor matter only. Failure of Rough Consensus may be declared by dissenting members.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>7.3</span> Matters unresolved refer back to further group discussion.<br/>
<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>7.4</span> The external avenue for disputes is to file a dispute according to CAcert's Dispute Resolution Policy <span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>DRP =&gt; COD7.</span> <span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>(DRP [COD7]).</span><br/>
