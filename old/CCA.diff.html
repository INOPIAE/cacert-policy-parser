Your liability is limited to a total maximum of 1000 Euros. "Foreign Courts" may assert jurisdiction. These include your local courts, and are outside our Arbitration.

<span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>3.</span><br/>
<span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>3</span> Law and Jurisdiction<br/>
3.1 Governing Law This agreement is governed under the law of New South Wales, Australia, being the home of the CAcert Inc. Association.<br/>
3.2 Arbitration as Forum of Dispute Resolution You agree, with CAcert and all of the Community, that all disputes arising out of or in connection to our use of CAcert services shall be referred to and finally resolved by Arbitration under the rules within the Dispute Resolution Policy of CAcert (DRP <span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>=&gt; COD7).</span> <span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>[COD7]).</span> The rules select a single Arbitrator chosen by CAcert from among senior Members in the Community. The ruling of the Arbitrator is binding and final on Members and CAcert alike. In general, the jurisdiction for resolution of disputes is within CAcert's own forum of Arbitration, as defined and controlled by its own rules (DRP <span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>=&gt; COD7).</span> <span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>[COD7]).</span> We use Arbitration for many purposes beyond the strict nature of disputes, such as governance and oversight. A systems administrator may need authorisation to conduct a non-routine action, and Arbitration may provide that authorisation. Thus, you may find yourself party to Arbitration that is simply support actions, and you may file disputes in order to initiate support actions.<br/>
3.3 Termination The CAcert Community Agreement is terminated based on a Policy Group decision following (PoP <span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>=&gt; COD1).</span> <span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>[COD1]).</span> This terminates the Agreement with every member. with a ruling of the Arbitrator or the completion of a termination process defined by an Arbitrator ruling (DRP <span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>=&gt; COD7).</span> <span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>[COD7]).</span> by the end of existence of a member (i.e. death in the case of individuals). A member may declare the wish to resign from CAcert at any time by writing to support AT cacert.org. This triggers a process for termination of this agreement with the member.<br/>
3.3a Consequences of Termination The termination discontinues the right to USE, OFFER and CREATE personal certificates in any account of the former member. Those certificates will be revoked and all services to the former member will be terminated as soon as possible. However, some information will continue to be held for certificate processing purposes. The provisions on Arbitration for the time of membership survive any termination. Former members are still bound by the DRP <span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>(COD7),</span> <span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>[COD7],</span> and the Arbitrator may reinstate any provision of this agreement or bind them to a ruling. As far as Organisations are concerned details are also defined in the Organisation Assurance Policy (OAP <span style='background-color:#FFBBBB'>=&gt; COD11).</span> <span style='background-color: #BBFFBB'>[COD11]).</span> Every member learning about the death of a member or termination of existence of a member should notify support AT cacert.org.<br/>
3.4 Changes of Agreement CAcert may from time to time vary the terms of this Agreement. Changes will be done according to the documented CAcert policy for changing policies, and is subject to scrutiny and feedback by the Community. Changes will be notified to you by email to your primary address. If you do not agree to the changes, you may terminate as above.
