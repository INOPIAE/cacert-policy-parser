<h1>CAcert Policy Cleaning Proposal</h1>
<p>
Currently CAcerts policies are managed by many people writing differently-styled and differently-valid html source.
The vote, if a policy document is going to be changed is based upon a HTML-document/HTML-source.
</p>
<p>
This page aims to give you an overview of what the change is going to be, if it is accepted.
</p>
<p>
The best impression of what the new policy-files would look like might be by looking at the <a href='policy'>generated HTML files</a> directly.
From this new "index"-page you can navigate directly to all Policy Documents, that have been already converted (That are at least, AP, CCA, CCS, DRP, OAP and PoP).
</p>
<p>
The source of these documents can be found <a href="https://github.com/yellowant/cacert-policy-parser/tree/master/policyText">here</a>.
This is going to be the content that PolG votes on.
</p>
<p>
In order to help you understand what exactly changes on a character level, we prepared diffs.
We stripped the HTML of both the new and the old HTML-documents and re-formatted the text (e.g. removing spaces, newlines, etc).
Then we did a word-diff between those two document sets. You can see the result in the ".diff.html"-files <a href="old">here</a>.
You can also run that diff by yourself by cloning <a href="https://github.com/yellowant/cacert-policy-parser">https://github.com/yellowant/cacert-policy-parser</a>
and running "org.cacert.policy.GenerateDiffs" after having run "org.cacert.policy.PolicyGenerator", when you have "wdiff" installed.

If you'd only like to have a look on the stripping/reformating-tool, you can take a look <a href="https://github.com/yellowant/cacert-policy-parser/tree/master/src/test/java/org/cacert/policy/GenerateDiffs.java">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
With this proposal come content-changes to the PoP. Those changes are not yet made. You can look them up in the <a href="https://github.com/yellowant/cacert-policy-parser/tree/master/policyText/PoP.txt">new Policy File Format</a>, see the <a href="old/PoP.diff.html">diff the old PoP text-wise</a>, or look at the <a href="policy/PoP.html">proposed new PoP</a>.
