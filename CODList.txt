The {&&CCS} mandates the creation and management of a list of all 
documents controlled for formal audit and policy purposes ({&CCS#2.1}).
This list is located at svn.cacert.org/CAcert/Policies/ControlledDocumentList.html.

This list is managed by the Policy Officer according to the Change provisions of {&CCS#2.2}.

In this list, CAcert Official Document (or "COD") numbers are allocated, see 1st column below.
The allocation of a COD number indicates the document is on POLICY track, and plays a part in the overall CCS framework.
