Headings:
A line consisting solely of the given strings:
"= 1 Heading ="  ->  "<h1>1 Heading</h1>"
"== 1.3 Heading ==" -> "<h2>1.3 Heading</h2>"

The numbering must be strictly increasing. I.e. the following numbering is allowed:
= 1 Heading =
== 1.1 Sub Heading ==
== 1.2 Sub Heading ==
== 1.2a Sub Heading ==
== 1.3 Sub Heading ==
= 2 Heading =

Removing any line except the "1.3" one will make this numbering invalid.
In the following numbering all transitions are not allowed.

// starting not with 0 or 1
= 2. Heading =
// Sub Heading starting not with 0 or one
== 2.2 Sub Heading ==
// letters don't start with 'a'
== 2.2b Sub Heading ==
// sub heading 2.3 missing
== 2.3a Sub Heading ==

Text Flow:

A newline causes a new paragraph to be generated
a "\\" at the end of a line causes a in-paragraph linebreak. Use with care.
